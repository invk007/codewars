"""Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and
returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive
days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was
less than or equal to the price of that day.

Implement the StockSpanner class:

    StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
    int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's
    price is price.
